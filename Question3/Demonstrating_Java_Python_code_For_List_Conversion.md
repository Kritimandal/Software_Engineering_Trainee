Demonstrating Python code for converting an iterator to a list

First of all,  a range function is used to generate a sequence from 1 to 20.  Then iter() method is used to create an iterator from the sequence. Python iter() method returns the iterator object, it is used to convert an iterable to the iterator. The list() is a bulit-in python function that returns a list. The list() method is used to convert iterator to list. Lastly, the list is printed as output.



Demonstrating Java code for converting an iterator to a list

The import function is used to import necessary class i.e. Arrays, ArrayList, Iterator and List from java.util package. The main class IteratorToList is define with public access modifier to make it accessible from any other class. Then main function is defined which is the entery point of java application. It means, the code starts executing from this point. String[] args is passed as parameter which is used to pass command line arguments. Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3) is used to creates a List containing the integers 1, 2, and 3. The iterator() method can be used to get an Iterator for collection. A new empty arraylist is created to store the elements of the iterator.  While loop is used to loop through the iterator. Iterator. Iterator.hasNext() checks wheather there exist another element to loop through in a iterator. Then data in retrived from the iterator and added to the list with each iteration. Finally, the list is printed as output.  

In java. It requires manual iteration through the iterator and manually adding them to the list. Hence it’s time consuming and complex. However, in python, there’s a built-in function for this.
