Question 12: OpenHIE Open-Source Research

OpenHIE stands for Open Health Information Exchange. It is a modular framework for building health information systems that are interoperable, scalable and sustainable. The OpenHIE framework is based on OpenHIM. This is an open-source middleware technology that provides a central point for managing, accessing and transfering patient healthcare informations. It is free to use. OpenHIM has three main layers which are as follows. 

1. Architecture Components Layer:
The architecture component layer includes two services: Business Domain Services and Registry Services. Business domain components are specially designed for  specific areas within the health system and can integrate data from various point-of-service and point-of-care systems. Registry services are programmed to uniquely identify and monitor individual patients, healthcare facilities, products, and terminology used across the health information exchange.


2. Interoperability Layer:

In this layer, FHIR standards and OpenHIM are used for data exchange between  CHT and other external health-care systems. It provides a standard mechanism for data exchange in healthcare system irrespective of the underlying technology or data formats used by each system.

3. Point of Service Layer
Points of service  layer is used for accessing and updating patient’s person-centric shared health records. It is also used to keep recods of healthcare transaction. It cosist of  OpenMRS electronic medical records (EMR) system and the RapidSMS mHealth application which are used by clinicians and by community health workers to access and update a patient’s health records.
