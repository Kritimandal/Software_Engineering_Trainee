I worked on the Fake News Detection System. Python's Django framework was used to create the Fake News Detector. The application aids in determining the authenticity of news by informing the user whether the news is genuine or not. Importing the news into our system allows us to verify its authenticity. Slow internet access can slow down the application's performance, but no excessive delay was observed. The application received the news dataset with 87.42% accuracy. The application was created in response to growing concerns about the impact of fake and nonsense news on mental health. As a result, this application was created to provide users with accurate and up-to-date news. The above-mentioned (Naive Bayes) approach involves more human error.

Consuming news has both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, consumers seek for and consume news because it is inexpensive, simple to use, and quickly disseminated. It makes it possible for "fake news," or low-quality news containing obviously erroneous facts, to spread widely. The widespread dissemination of fake news has the potential to have very negative effects on people and society. As a result, the detection of fake news has recently been a rapidly developing field of study. First, it is challenging and nontrivial to identify fake news based solely on the news's content because it is purposefully designed to encourage readers to believe incorrect information.

Still, there are some issues that require a lot of information to understand, and we can also determine from the outcomes whether or not it's a rumor, and if so, how much. For these issues, we tend to think that a combination of information and knowledge is required to investigate those issues that are also confusing.

Purpose:
The goal of Fake News Detection System is to implement and analyze Naïve Bayes for classification of news into real or fake. The main aim of the project is to provide an attractive and user-friendly website to help users detect fake news circulating in social media and the internet.

We often get easily fooled by the fake or rumored news while surfing the internet. Thus this will spread distrust among people. Nothing that can be used objectively will be left. It involves the breakdown of social and political coherence. 

Objectives:
 The purpose of our project is to design web applications to detect fake news. The main goals are:
    • To give users with a platform for determining whether or not the news is accurate.
    • To create a mechanism for determining the authenticity of news.
    • Use machine learning technlogy to determine news authencity rather than having humans manually review thousands of news articles.
